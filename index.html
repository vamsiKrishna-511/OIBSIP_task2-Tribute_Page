            school, she started teaching songs to other children. When the teacher stopped her, she was so angry that she stopped going to the school.<br>

            When Mangeshkar was 13, her father died of heart disease. Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend 
            of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He helped Lata get started in a career as a singer and actress. Her first Hindi song was "Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya

            to producer Sashadhar Mukherjee, who was working then on the movie Shaheed, but Mukherjee dismissed Mangeshkar's voice as "too thin".An annoyed Haider responded
